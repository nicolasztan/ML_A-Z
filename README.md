# Machine Learning A-Z: Nicolas' Mastery Timeline Topics
### (Spring 2024)
As I ventured into the robotics industry as Software Test & Automation Engineering, I realized that becoming a more robust Robotics Software Engineer meant being able to implement Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) into self-developed projects involving hardware and algorithmns (path planning, computer vision, etc). For this dream to become a reality however, I understood this meant being able to grasp the precursors of Machine Learning and Deep Learning. 

This repository serves to be a personal and communal benchmark detailing how to progress as a self-learner if curious about following this path as an RSE. 
I grew inspired by the embedded link on this repo, 'Machine Learning A-Z' by Udemy. I give props to them for the motivation and as the resource I used upon my initial journey debuting February 2024.
